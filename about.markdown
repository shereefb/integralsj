Social Justice, Diversity, Inclusion, and Multi-Culturlism are complicated, rich, and important ideas that are shaping our generation.

In recent years, these ideals have been co-opted by a radical, puritanical and subversive current of thought. This goes by many names: identity politics, wokeness, critical race theory...etc. 

This website is an attempt at a corrective: A discernment that re-establishes the core values of these ideals, and differentiates them from their shadow.

Our hope is to contribute in a small way to a truly diverse and just world. And to honor the sacrifices of those who came before us, by liberating their work from the toxic idealogy that is distorting it.
